- Events generally bubble up the dom from the spot where they riginate from

- this means that every parent element will be notified that an event ocored and will have the opportunity to respond

- A callback is when you use a function as a parmerter to another function

function aFunction(function) {
callback
}


function outerFunction() {

}




.preventDefault(); prevents default response of event handler and only runs JS
.stopPropagation(); prevents response from bubbling up the dom
